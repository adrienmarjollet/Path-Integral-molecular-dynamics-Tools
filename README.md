Various useful tools one might use in a path-integral molecular dynamics framework.

Eckhart_algo.py : Provite the Eckart conditions which allow the approximate separation of rotation from vibration. Although the rotational and vibrational motions of the nuclei in a molecule cannot be fully separated, the Eckart conditions minimize the coupling close to a reference (usually equilibrium) configuration. This algorithm is specific to RPMD and was applied for the first time in a path-integral context in my thesis.
